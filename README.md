## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

You can check your versions with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Install

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishbhuva03/Krish-PortFolio.git
cd Krish-PortFolio
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
```

### Run Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make edits.

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build in the `build/` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can serve the `build` directory using a static server or deploy to services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite (if available).

## Notes on Code

- I will not modify any code files as requested. The repository already contains components for education, projects, resume, and more.
- If you want adjustments to layout or content, open the corresponding files in `src/components/` and update them.
